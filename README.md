# Ableton.js

[![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ableton-js.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ableton-js/)

Ableton.js lets you control your instance or instances of Ableton using Node.js.
It tries to cover as many functions as possible.

This package is still a work-in-progress. My goal is to expose all of
[Ableton's MIDI Remote Script](https://julienbayle.studio/PythonLiveAPI_documentation/Live10.0.2.xml)
functions to TypeScript. If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to do so.

## Prerequisites

To use this library, you'll need to install and activate the MIDI Remote Script
in Ableton.js. To do that, copy the `midi-script` folder of this repo to
Ableton's Remote Scripts folder. If you prefer, you can rename it to something
like `AbletonJS` for better identification. The MIDI Remote Scripts folder is
usually located at:

- **Windows:** {path to Ableton}\Resources\MIDI\Remote Scripts
- **macOS:** /Applications/Ableton Live {version}/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI
  Remote Scripts

After starting Ableton Live, add the script to your list of control surfaces:

If you've forked this project on macOS, you can also use yarn to do that for
you. Running `yarn ableton:start` will copy the `midi-script` folder, open
Ableton and show a stream of log messages until you kill it.

## Using Ableton.js

This library exposes an `Ableton` class which lets you control the entire
application. You can instantiate it once and use TS to explore available
features.

Example:

```typescript
import { Ableton } from "ableton-js";

const ableton = new Ableton();

const test = async () => {
  ableton.song.addListener("is_playing", p => console.log("Playing:", p));
  ableton.song.addListener("tempo", t => console.log("Tempo:", t));

  const cues = await ableton.get("cue_points");
  console.log(cues.map(c => c.raw));
};

test();
```

## Protocol

Ableton.js uses UDP to communicate with the MIDI Script. Each message is a JSON
object containing required data and a UUID so request and response can be
associated with each other.

### Compression and Chunking

To allow sending large JSON payloads, responses from the MIDI Script are
compressed using gzip and chunked every 1024 bytes. The first byte of every
message contains the chunk index (0x00-0xFF) followed by the gzipped chunk. The
last chunk always has the index 0xFF. This indicates to the JS library that the
previous received messages should be stiched together, unzipped, and processed.

### Commands

A command payload consists of the following properties:

```js
{
  "uuid": "a20f25a0-83e2-11e9-bbe1-bd3a580ef903", // A unique command id
  "ns": "song", // The command namespace
  "nsid": null, // The namespace id, for example to address a specific track or device
  "name": "get_prop", // Command name
  "args": { "prop": "current_song_time" } // Command arguments
}
```

The MIDI Script answers with a JSON object looking like this:

```js
{
  "data": 0.0, // The command's return value, can be of any JSON-compatible type
  "event": "result", // This can be 'result' or 'error'
  "uuid": "a20f25a0-83e2-11e9-bbe1-bd3a580ef903"
}
```

### Events

To attach an event listener to a specific property, the client sends a command
object:

```js
{
  "uuid": "922d54d0-83e3-11e9-ba7c-917478f8b91b", // A unique command id
  "ns": "song", // The command namespace
  "name": "add_listener", // The command to add an event listener
  "args": {
    "prop": "current_song_time", // The property that should be watched
    "eventId": "922d2dc0-83e3-11e9-ba7c-917478f8b91b" // A unique event id
  }
}
```

The MIDI Script answers with a JSON object looking like this to confirm that the
listener has been attached:

```js
{
  "data": "922d2dc0-83e3-11e9-ba7c-917478f8b91b", // The unique event id
  "event": "result", // Should be result, is error when something goes wrong
  "uuid": "922d54d0-83e3-11e9-ba7c-917478f8b91b" // The unique command id
}
```

From now on, when the observed property changes, the MIDI Script sends an event
object:

```js
{
  "data": 68.0, // The new value, can be any JSON-compatible type
  "event": "922d2dc0-83e3-11e9-ba7c-917478f8b91b", // The event id
  "uuid": null // Is always null and may be removed in future versions
}
```

Note that for some values, this event is emitted multiple times per second.
20-30 updates per second are not unusual.

### Connection Events

The MIDI Script sends events when it starts and when it shuts down. These look
like this:

```js
{
  "data": null, // Is always null
  "event": "connect", // Can be connect or disconnect
  "uuid": null // Is always null and may be removed in future versions
}
```

When you open a new Project in Ableton, the script will shut down and start
again.

When Ableton.js receives a disconnect event, it clears all current event
listeners and pending commands. It is usually a good idea to attach all event
listeners and get properties each time the `connect` event is emitted.

### Findings

In this section, I'll note interesting pieces of information related to
Ableton's Python framework that I stumble upon during the development of this
library.

- It seems like Ableton's listener to `output_meter_level` doesn't quite work as
  well as expected, hanging every few 100ms. Listening to `output_meter_left` or
  `output_meter_right` works better. See
